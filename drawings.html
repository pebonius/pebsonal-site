      <p>this is a gallery of my drawings</p>
      <p>
        i currently upload them to
        <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/peb.blue">my bsky</a>
      </p>
      <p>i used to be interested in digital illustration a long time ago</p>
      <p>
        now i just draw with a cheap ink pen straight to paper bc putting in
        effort is annoying
      </p>
      <p>i like character design and anatomy the most</p>
      <p>recently i try drawing different things</p>
