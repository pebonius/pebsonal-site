      <p>
        this was my entry for the
        <a href="https://itch.io/jam/tavern-keeper-jam">tavern keeper jam</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        after making <a href="./high-council-chair">high council chair</a> for
        the chair jam, i wanted to do something less shitposty. there's some
        stupid jokes, but mostly this is a chill tavern management game.
      </p>
      <p>
        i joined the jam like a week before deadline and spent most my time
        adding the patrons, so that this qualified for the jam. if i had more
        time i'd add a cooking mechanic and a bunch more things. people still
        liked it so its fine
      </p>
      <p>
        i added a post-jam build later, with ending for the story and some minor
        fixes
      </p>

            >I think you were one of the first people to upload a game for the
            jam right? Kudos because this is great!!! It's cute, simple, and
            straightforward. I don't know if you ever plan to do a full release
            beyond the jam version, but I'd be excited to see the cooking
            mechanic in action. I also really enjoy your sense of humor and
            writing style. "Give me water or I shall perish" had me cracking the
            fuck up. - -- me too knight guy, me too. Great work Peb!</span

            >I very much liked the twist of switching roles and playing as the
            tavernkeep that serves the adventurers instead! The gameplay was in
            that sweet spot between stressful and fun, and the humor kept
            catching me riiight when I wasn't expecting it. So If you ever plan
            on expanding this, there is lots of potential!!</span
