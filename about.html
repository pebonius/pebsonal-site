        since 2017 i have been uploading my games to itch under username
        <a href="https://pebonius.itch.io/">pebonius</a>. my games are mostly
        small shitposts created in rpgmaker and renpy for the entertainment of
        the masses and of myself. i currently resolved to upload jam games to
        itch, my other games will be uploaded to this here site.
      </p>
      <p class="longtext">
        between 2023 and 2024 i have also created a bunch of free pixelart
        assets, which some people liked. all my assets are available
        on my <a href="https://pebonius.itch.io/">itch</a> or
        <a href="https://opengameart.org/users/pebonius">OGA account</a>. at
        some point i'd like to collect them all here. i rarely do pixelart
        anymore, but if i ever feel like it, i will :&rpar;&rpar;&rpar;
      </p>
      <p class="longtext">
        i also draw sometimes and post my scribblings over on
        <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/peb.blue">my bsky</a>. you can find my
        older drawings on the <a href="./drawings.html">drawings page</a>. i
        used to be interested in digital illustration and vg character design a
        long time ago, but didn't do much about that. now i've become a pro at
        drawing low effort doodles with a cheap ink pen.
      </p>
      <p class="longtext">
        i would like to try other things at some point, such as voice acting or
        music. if you're making a game and need a really bad voice actor hit me
        up!
