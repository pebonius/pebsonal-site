        between 2017 and 2025 i had been uploading my games on itch under
        username peb. my games are mostly small shitposts created in rpgmaker
        and renpy for the entertainment of the masses and of myself. in 2025 i
        decided to remove my works from itch and host them here.

        between 2023 and 2025 i have also created a bunch of free pixelart
        assets, which some people liked. all my pixel art will be available
        here, and also on my
        <a href="https://opengameart.org/users/pebonius">openGameArt account</a
        >.
